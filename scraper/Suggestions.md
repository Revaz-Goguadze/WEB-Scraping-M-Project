Here is a checklist of items to review or implement in your code and repository to aim for the "Excellent" grade, based on the `TASK.MD` criteria:

**Code Implementation Checklist:**

1.  **Data Collection (`scraper/collector.py`, `scraper/async_collector.py`):**
    *   \[X] **Robust Error Handling:** Ensure `fetch` methods use `try...except` blocks to catch potential `requests.exceptions.RequestException` (like connection errors, timeouts) and handle non-200 HTTP status codes appropriately.
    *   \[X] **HTTP Headers:** Confirm a descriptive `User-Agent` header (and any other necessary headers) is sent with every request.
    *   \[X] **Rate Limiting:** Verify the `delay` mechanism effectively pauses between requests as intended.
    *   \[X] **Robots.txt:** Confirm `check_robots_txt` correctly parses the file and prevents scraping disallowed paths.

2.  **Data Parsing (`scraper/parser.py`):**
    *   \[X] **Multiple Selection Methods:** Confirm *at least three different* BeautifulSoup selection methods (e.g., `find_all()`, `select()`, find by attribute `attrs={}`) are used effectively.
    *   \[X] **DOM Navigation:** Ensure logic correctly navigates the HTML structure if needed to extract nested data.
    *   \[X] **Missing Element Handling:** Verify that methods gracefully handle cases where expected HTML elements are not found (e.g., return `None`, empty list, or use `try...except AttributeError`).

3.  **OOP Design (`models/data_models.py`):**
    *   \[X] **Proper Documentation:** Ensure all classes (`Book`, `Category`) and their methods (`__init__`, `to_dict`, `add_book`, etc.) have clear, complete docstrings explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.

4.  **Data Storage (`utils/file_handler.py`):**
    *   \[X] **File Error Handling:** Ensure `save_*` and `load_*` functions use `try...except` blocks to handle potential `IOError`, `FileNotFoundError`, permission errors, etc.

5.  **Project Structure & Documentation (Overall & Files):**
    *   \[X] **Comprehensive README.md:** Verify it includes: Project Description, Detailed Setup/Installation, Usage Examples, Technologies Used, Documented Limitations, Potential Improvements.
    *   \[X] **Comprehensive CONTRIBUTIONS.md:** Verify it details specific contributions for *each* team member, linking to relevant Issues/PRs.
    *   \[X] **Comprehensive REPORT.md:** Verify it meets content requirements (website choice/justification, challenges/solutions, data analysis description, improvements) and word count (500-700 words).
    *   \[X] **Code Comments:** Add inline comments (`# comment`) to explain any complex or non-obvious logic sections within functions/methods across all modules.
    *   \[X] **Docstrings:** Double-check that *all* functions and methods across `scraper`, `models`, and `utils` have complete docstrings.
 
**GitHub Repository Checklist:**
 
6.  **Repository & Workflow:**
    *   \[X] **Public/Shared:** Confirm repository is public or shared with the instructor.
    *   \[ ] **`.gitignore` & `LICENSE`:** Ensure a Python `.gitignore` and an appropriate `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT) are present.
    *   \[X] **Branching:** Confirm `main` branch is protected, and work is done on `dev` and `feature/*` branches.
    *   \[X] **Issues:** Verify *all* tasks/features were tracked via Issues with descriptive titles, criteria, assignments, and labels. Check the Project board usage.
    *   \[X] **Pull Requests:** Confirm *all* code merges used PRs, linked to Issues, had descriptions, and show evidence of code review by at least one other team member.
    *   \[X] **Commits:** Check history for descriptive messages (e.g., `FEAT: Add book parsing`), logical size, and correct author details.
    *   \[X] **Submission Tag:** Ensure the final commit for submission is tagged exactly as `midterm-submission`.

Reviewing and ensuring these specific points are addressed should help you meet the "Excellent" criteria for the midterm project.
